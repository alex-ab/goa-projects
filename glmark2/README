[https://github.com/glmark2/glmark2 - glMark2] is an OpenGL 2.0 and ES 2.0
benchmark with Genode patches applied. It is the same version as found in the
Genode [https://github.com/genodelabs/genode-world - World] repository, but uses
glMark2' native build system which is Meson.

This project is currently used for testing Goa's Meson support and will not work
with the current Genode/Goa release (24.04) because some Genode API changes are
already implemented here.

Building
--------

# Adjust depot user in _used_apis_ and _pkg/glmark2/archives_.

# Adjust goarc:

* versions_from_genode_dir <path to genode source>
* depot_user               <depot user>

# build necessary API in Genode (_used_apis_)

# Disable strict warnings in Goa:

  ! goa build --no-warn-strict

  or in goarc:

  ! set warn_strict 0

# export to Genode depot

  ! goa export
